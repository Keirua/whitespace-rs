# Whitespace Examples

## Hello, World!

    Here is the ubiquitous Hello World program. Note how the characters are converted to a binary encoding. The subroutine for writing out a string is also interesting.

## Hello, user!

    Slightly extended from the previous program, this program asks the user their name before saying hello to them. The subroutine for reading in a string is particularly interesting. Note how the input is duplicated twice, since we need to use it multiple times.

## Calculator

    To demonstrate a bit of arithmetic. Fairly straightforward, but again notice that the majority of the work is in stack manipulation to keep track of the local variables.

## Factorial

    This program demonstrates how we can handle arbitrarily big numbers and recursion. Note the definition of the factorial function quite happily calls itself since the only storage it uses is on the stack.

##Towers of Hanoi

    This program works out a solution for the towers of hanoi problem, recursively, and shows the use of stack frames for local variables in recursive functions.

## Fibonacci

    Written by Chris Morris, this is the other canonical way of showing how recursion works.

## [Fact|Tut]orial

    A version of the tutorial which, when executed, does the same as the factorial program above.
