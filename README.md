# whitespace-rs

[whitespace language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_%28programming_language%29) interpreter, in Rust.

It's an [esoteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) stack-based language with 24 instructions that only use `tab`, `space` and `line feed`. Think assembly, but with a smaller instruction set, and with unreadable characters.

Unfortunately the original language page is dead, but it still lives on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20150426193527/http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/tutorial.php). A copy of the original Haskell implementation is copied inside the `docs/WSpace` directory

# Todo

 - [ ] write all the instructions in the virtual machine along with tests

      // stack
      - [x] Push(i32)
      - [x] Duplicate
      - [ ] CopyNth(i32)
      - [x] Swap
      - [x] Discard
      - [ ] Slide(i32)
      // arithmetic
      - [x] Add
      - [x] Sub
      - [x] Mul
      - [x] Div
      - [x] Mod
      // heap
      - [x] Store
      - [x] Retrieve
      // flow control
      - [x] SetLabel(String)
      - [x] CallSubroutine(String)
      - [x] Jump(String)
      - [x] JZero(String)
      - [x] JNeg(String)
      - [x] EndOfSubroutine
      - [x] EndOfProgram
      // I/O -> need a better implementation that allows for tests
      - [-] PrintChar
      - [-] PrintInt
      - [ ] ReadChar
      - [ ] ReadInt

 - [ ] make the VM able to use different streams for I/O (easier testing)
 - [ ] parser: fix the crash due to out of bounds exceptions
 - [ ] automated tests for every critical branch of the parser
 - [ ] add some property-based tests in the parser
 - [ ] automated tests for every critical branch of the virtual machine
 - [ ] ensure every example program can run
 - [ ] use a more strict data type in the parser (in order to only allow space/tabs/lf at compile time)
 - [ ] simplify/shorten parse_instruction, many things are repeated there
 - [ ] functionnal tests for the parser that use real programs
 - [ ] write some documentation
 - [ ] cleanup the copies and unwrap as much as possible
 - [x] cleanup this mess with mutable/immutable borrows in `run_instruction`
 - [ ] implement arbitrary precision integers ?
 - [ ] turns this into a compiler because why not ?
